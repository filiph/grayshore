# Grayshore Open Source Campaign Setting

Grayshore is an old-school fantasy setting for roleplaying games (like 
Dungeons & Dragons), computer games and whatever else that needs a consistent
world.

The setting is licensed under CC0, which means you can freely use it,
even in commercial works, with no strings attached. It is also open source
(meaning that all assets, code, maps, and text are publicly available) and
accepting pull requests.

The setting itself has these guiding principles:

1. High adventure 
2. Diversity
3. Systems

## High adventure

Provide opportunities for escapist power fantasies. We humans love
feeling smart, strong, adept, and important, and — by extension — enjoy
empathizing with others in such positions.

The concepts of "escapism" and "power fantasy" have bad connotations but
here they are used neutrally. The stories of Harry Potter, Star Wars, 
Lord of the Rings, Wonder Woman, Black Panther or Indiana Jones are all escapist
power fantasies. They follow people who are unnaturally smart, strong, adept, 
and important. That doesn't mean the works cannot have a message. It just makes
their initial premise more attractive and enjoyable.

In concrete terms, Grayshore is all about high-stakes conflict, freedom, 
heroism, leadership opportunities, challenging trials, exotic places, powerful
entities, and combat.

Grayshore is home to some creatures who are undeniably evil. For
example, kobolds and orcs in this setting are vicious, cruel, bloodthirsty 
killers. They are here to provide conflict without the need
of much setup and with minimal moral dilemma for the players. They are the
Grayshore equivalents of Storm Troopers, Nazis and Dementors.

That does not mean _all_ conflict in this setting is like that. Most adversaries
are examples of [Grey and Gray Morality][]. But there are some simple conflicts
in Grayshore, and those are the ones people have come to expect from
fantasy fiction (orcs versus humans, dwarves versus elves, and so on).

## Diversity

The setting and its inhabitants are diverse. 

One aspect of this principle is the variety of possible places to visit.
To use the aforementioned stories as examples again, think of all
the exotic places shown in a typical Star Wars, Indiana Jones
or Harry Potter movie. Think of the sheer diversity of the characters.

The other aspect of this is a little less obvious but at least as important as 
the first one. Old school, medieval fantasy settings sometimes tend to reflect
old school, medieval world views. This leads to fantasy settings with diminished
value of women, absence of persons of color, religious supremacy, etc. None 
of this is beneficial for the Grayshore campaign setting — it is preferable to 
[project][PCHistory] today's values to the imagined medieval-like world.

## Systems

Heroic stories are, by definition, about an individual's power to change
the world. We like tales where a single person stands up to something
and wins. The solution to a problem is often a single, tangible act, such as
cutting a knot, killing an evil wizard, or throwing a ring into lava.

This is the core of Hero's Journey, an archetype shared between various
cultures of Earth. It's not just some recent fad. It's a deep human
preference. And it's possibly also a very useful belief.

Yet, we all know that the world doesn't work like that. The world is
a massive, counter-intuitive system full of weird ripple effects, feedback
loops, and emergent phenomena. Here in reality, one-off deeds
by single individuals seldom solve anything. There is no magic ring the
destruction of which will make evil go away. Killing a single leader is
as likely to make things worse as it is to make things better. 
And cutting a knot when everyone is trying to _untie_ it ...
that's just a dick move.

This setting is about high adventure. Problems that the players will be facing
_should_ conform with the Hero's Journey. They _should_ be solvable by
easy-to-understand (though not easy to execute!) acts. When there's
a dragon on the loose, we _don't_ expect the players to ponder the implications
of dragon slaying on the local ecology.

But that shouldn't be an excuse to make the whole setting simplistic. Heroics
is the lens we're looking _through_, but the subject we're looking _at_
can be a complex system.

The dragon from the example above will be a simple external threat but its
presence can have complex effects on geopolitics, trade, religion,
migration, or whatever else you think of.

If you're not familiar with the concept of systems dynamics, I can recommend
reading [Thinking in Systems][Meadows] (or at least watching the
[15 minute MIT course introduction][MITcourse]).
