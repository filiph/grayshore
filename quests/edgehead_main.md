# Edgehead main quest

## The "Hero's Journey" framework:

- Captivating or emotionally involving character ...
  - A sickly kid with a natural and untamed talent for necromancy ...
- ... pursuing some compelling desire ...
  - ... has fled home to rescue his/her kidnapped brother ...
- ... and faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles in achieving it.
  - ... and has to join an elite order of knights to find him.

## The hero

* Working name: Aren
* Son/Daughter of an impoverished lord
* Burden: everyone assumes Aren will be the reasonable child, and will use his education to get a stable bureacratic job under a higher lord
* Secret: Aren has powers of necromancy (extreme healing, really) but never says it because this kind of magic has a stigma.

### Sidekick

We need an entity with which the hero can have conversation while adventuring yet that isn't too powerful or a burden. Basically, we need something that will mostly get out of harm's way, yet will be around most of the time. Something that the player can attach to despite it not being that much attached to the player.

Therefore: Aren has a talking cat called Conscience.

## The villain

TBD
