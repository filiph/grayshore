# Reasons

## Why genre fantasy?

You might be wondering why anyone even builds a classic fantasy setting anymore. There are hundreds of them. Wouldn't it be better to stay away from fantasy altogether and instead use a historical setting (ancient Rome, medieval Japan, etc.) or modern setting?

Here are the reasons Grayshore goes with fantasy:

* We want magic. It can make many mechanics much more interesting than they would be without magic. For example, in a non-magic world, combat often boils down to fighting skill. In a magic world, there are magic items, magic weapons, spells, necromancy, telepathy, etc. There are whole new ways of changing the course of a fight.

* We want usual combat to raise no moral questions. A feral, cruel, evil orc is such an enemy on an archetypal / fairy tale level. A Roman slave owner is not, and you need to work hard to make him a morally okay target of player violence. (Work and time that you could spend elsewhere.)

* Tropes work. An orc hitting a slave is all you need to know at the start of a game. You immediately know this world will have swordfighting, magic, fantastical beasts, and all that other stuff.

## Why San Francisco Bay Area?

The iconic status of many sights around the Bay Area, like the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco skyline, Alcatraz, and so on, is a great shortcut. It helps players orient themselves, it helps their imagination, and it helps them remember the scenes that they play through.

There is a big difference between a) crossing the Adamantian Bridge to meet the wizard in the Tower of the Trident and b) hacking through the overgrowth on the ancient [Bay Bridge][BayBridge] to meet the wizard of the [Pyramid][TransamericaPyramid].
