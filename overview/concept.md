# Concept

The myths people had about magic, goblins, dragons and other supernatural phenomena weren't actually legends -- they were foreknowledge. Collective prescience of things to come.

In other words, these stories weren't true when people told them, but they were _going to be_ true in the time ahead.

This setting takes place in a future where most of humanity lives with medieval technology and among creatures such as goblins, giant spiders and ghouls. Some remnants of today's (21st century) technology are still around but, because of their age, most of them are useless for their original purpose. Only the most durable buildings (like suspension bridges, highways, skyscrapers and bunkers) are recognizable, though invariably overgrown with flora.

Magic is rare and subdued. Basic healing, regeneration, posession, necromancy, pyrokinesis are among the most common types of magic. Many common people live their lives without ever seeing an actual act of wizardry.

Society has reformed around many of the medieval organizational principles (knighthood, city states, guilds) but not all of them. After all, these are medieval-like times in the future, _after_ globalization and human rights movements have run their course. Ethnicities are much less segregated (e.g. knights and aristocracy can be as easily black or asian as they are white). Religion is a lot more diverse (e.g. hinduism, atheism, cargo cults, christianity, judaism). Gender views are a lot less, well, medieval (e.g. female leaders and scholars as frequent as male ones, homosexuality not a stigma). Of course there are still bigots, but their worldview can't lean on tradition. Saying racist things in this setting isn't "conservative" -- it is literaly crazy talk.

Power in this setting is much more geographically fragmented than it is today. There are small states and fiefdoms and independent cities. Information, people and goods travel at the speed of a horse at best, so it is much harder to build and maintain larger political entities. Forms of government range from monarchies to oligarchies to theocracies to democracies.

Information from our age (21st century) is still available to scholars who learn how to extract it from artifacts (rare books, extremely rare devices that still work). But the experience is so different that the knowledge is seldom directly applicable, and so it doesn't tend to trickle down from scholars to common people. The existence of "Archons" (that is, us) is widely known but the history is so old it borders with myth.

Most people work manually, in the field. The ratio is not as bad as in the middle ages (where 95-99% people worked the land) -- mainly because of the ability to grow modern crops -- but it is still considerable. Another common carreer is the military (political fragmentation and the existence of vicious monsters provide plenty of conflict). The rest of the economy is similar to that of medieval Europe.

Heroes (i.e. supernaturally powerful adventurers) are a major force in all walks of life: politics, military, economy, culture, you name it. 

## Knights of San Francisco

The setting's geographical focus is on the area we now call San Francisco Bay Area. It is a place full of archon artifacts and structures, some of which will be familiar to players (Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz). It is also an interesting area in itself, with an ocean coast, a large bay, a mountain range, a valley, and so on.
