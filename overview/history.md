# History

From our perspective, the setting of Grayshore is more than a thousand years in the future.

BNE = Before New Era (equivalent to our BC or BCE) 
NE = New Era (equivalent to our AD) 

## The Shift (X00 BNE)

From our perspective, this is mere hundreds of years in the future.

Something major happens (what exactly is undefined as of this writing) and things that are previously assumed to be myths are starting to become reality.

## The Last War (60 BNE)

The new happenings destabilize everything. Remnants of the archon powers wage a war for survival, but the war only hurries their demise.

## Coming of the Dragons (0 NE)

The top of the food chain arrives. This is assumed by most to be the last "myth" to become reality (it is not).

... TBA... 

## The Dead Prince raises near San Francisco (1291 NE)

Start of the campaign.
